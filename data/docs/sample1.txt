Topic Modeling Techniques:

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic topic modeling algorithm that assumes documents are mixtures of topics and topics are mixtures of words. LDA is a generative statistical model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar. LDA is particularly useful for discovering hidden thematic structures in large collections of documents.

Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is another topic modeling technique that factorizes a non-negative matrix into two non-negative matrices. NMF is particularly good at finding parts-based representations of data, making it interpretable and useful for topic modeling. Unlike LDA, NMF doesn't make probabilistic assumptions and can work well with sparse data.

When to use LDA vs NMF:
- Use LDA when you have large datasets and want probabilistic topic assignments
- Use NMF when you want more interpretable topics and have smaller datasets
- LDA works better with longer documents
- NMF is more suitable for short texts and social media content
